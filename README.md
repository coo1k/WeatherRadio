Weather Radio
=============

This python program pulls weather data and reads it out loud. 
It will keep on doing this every 30 seconds. You can change the frequency by modifying INTERVAL(seconds) variable.

Before running this program, you'll need to create an API key on "weatherapi.com".
Replace the key in the program(API_KEY variable) and you're ready to go.

Disclaimer: No guarantees it will work. Use it at your own risk.
